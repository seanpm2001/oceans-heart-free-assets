Feel free to let me know what you're doing with this art at either of those places,
I hope this can help you create lovely games.

Small note, the tiles are very disorganized and redundant. I plan to create an
organized and complete tileset after completing my game. If you'd prefer less
chaos, I anitcipate being able to release this sometime late 2019.
